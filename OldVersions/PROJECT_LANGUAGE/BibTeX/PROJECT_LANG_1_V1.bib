Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-BibTeX
About:
I decided to make BibTeX the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-BibTeX) as BibTeX is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the BibTeX programming language. It only makes sense to BibTeX the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
